                    <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
                    <p class="text-body-emphasis">
                        Nowadays, technology is going fast and there is an endless number of sites, users have had to
                        adapt, so that in many of these sites you must have some record of personal or work data. It is notorious that
                        the habitual use of sites and information platforms have led to an inappropriate handling of them without
                        measuring the risks to which one is exposed every day in any of the roles in which the information is
                        involved, generating unsafe habits and leaving in a fragile way that a third party appropriates the information.<br><br>
                        Generally, it is very common that passwords are saved, but the question is how, some people keep them
                        in an order way with each change and / or update in a system, but usually most people during their
                        daily routine prefer to do it in writing, something very traditional and conservative, giving way to
                        vulnerability for the impersonation of personal and work information. <br><br>For that reason the PASST project is
                        proposed as the starting point, as an initiative of building a mobile application that seeks the approach
                        of technology for security based on the knowledge that has currently been acquired.
